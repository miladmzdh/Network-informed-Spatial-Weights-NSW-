# Network-informed Spatial Weights (NSW)

This repository provides a Python implementation of **Network-informed Spatial Weights (NSW)** â€” a methodology that integrates graph-based overlapping community detection into spatial econometric modeling. Instead of relying solely on geographic proximity, NSW constructs spatial weight matrices from functional linkages (e.g., commuting flows, trade networks) and includes tools for testing and correcting potential endogeneity in the weights.

## Overview

Spatial econometric models often depend on spatial weight matrices to represent interdependencies between units. Traditional schemes, such as contiguity or distance thresholds, may fail to capture non-geographic but economically important linkages. NSW addresses this limitation by:

- Representing spatial entities as nodes in a directed, weighted economic interaction network.
- Detecting overlapping communities using network science algorithms.
- Assigning primary communities based on strongest internal linkages.
- Constructing community-based spatial weight matrices.
- Testing for weight matrix endogeneity using Rao's score test.
- Applying corrections through control functions or PCA proxies when necessary.

This approach allows researchers to incorporate richer theoretical foundations into their models and better capture real-world interdependencies.

## Features

- **Flexible community detection**: Leiden multiplex, OSLOM, weighted cliques, ego-splitting.
- **Overlapping membership support**: Capture complex regional roles in multiple functional groups.
- **Primary community assignment**: Based on largest internal flow strength.
- **Community-based spatial weights**: Row-standardized for econometric use.
- **Endogeneity diagnostics**: Rao's score test for spatial weight matrices.
- **Endogeneity correction**: Control function and PCA proxy approaches.
- **Complete pipeline**: From raw flow data to model estimation.
